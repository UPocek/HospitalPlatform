# Web app prototype for hospital platform

### Project goal
This is a project from the course introduction to software engineering where the main focus was on learning about clean code principles. The task was to develop a web app that helps different roles in the hospital such as doctors, managers, patients, etc. in their everyday activities. Patients were able to schedule examinations and view their eRecord history. Doctors were able to see their schedule for the upcoming, log examinations, and see previous activities, history, and reports. Hospital managers could order necessary equipment and have insight into rooms and their statuses. At the end of the day, this was a pretty fun project and we learned a lot.

### Project structure
For the front end, we used vanilla javascript, for the back end we used .NET C# and for the database we used MongoDB.

### What we learned
- We learned a lot about developing REST API in C#
- How to organize data in NOSQL databases
- How to properly structure your code for MVC with the package by feature
- How to get the most out of your IDE
- How to properly use git and GitHub
